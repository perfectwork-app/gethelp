**Installing or uninstalling apps and managing users is up to you.**
As the administrator of your database, you are responsible for its usage, as you know best how your organization works.

- **PerfectWORK apps have dependencies**. Installing some apps and features with dependencies may also install additional apps and modules that are technically required, even if you won’t actively use them.
- **Test app installation/removal on a duplicate of your database**. This way, you can know what app dependencies may be required or what data may be erased.
